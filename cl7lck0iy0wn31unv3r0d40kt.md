## Let's design 404 Page

### Introduction

Think of 404 as essentially a landing page, no one wish to land on. But what to do if it happens ?. A well designed 404 page can make a good relationship with the users. They dont feel separated. But what makes a good 404 page? what contents are need to be placed in 404 page ?

### What is 404 ?
404 is a status code that tells a web user that a **requested page is not available**. 404 and other response status codes are part of the web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol response codes. The 404 code means that a server could not find a client-requested webpage. Variations of the error message include "404 Error," "404 Page Not Found" and "The requested URL was not found."

404 error codes are generated when a user attempts to access a webpage that does not exist, has been moved, or has a dead or broken link. The 404 error code is one of the most frequent errors a web user encounters. 

In simple words, a 404 error is a client-side error because the client (your web browser) is considered to be asking for a resource (the URL you clicked or entered) which does not exist, or cannot be found.

If you don't able to see it, you can access this site (https://archive.org/web/) to see what a specific URL looked like in the past.

Even in those usecases we need to provide the user with some designs, so they don't feel lost. 

### Contents to be placed in a 404 page 


Below are the contents, which are recommended, but its upto the users wish to select which suites them. 

- **An error message**
You need your user to recognize immediately that theyâ€™ve landed on an error page.

- **Link to your best content**
3 or 4 links to great content on your site should help guide lost visitors to something they find interesting. Try to avoid losing traffic, even from an error page.

- **Well designed page**
Make sure your 404 page matches the look and feel of your site. 

- **Some actions**
Add in a download or signup button, or at the very least, a search box. Try to convert the user to a subscriber. The best practice is to design a 404 page with a handful of key links, including a link to the Home page as an easy get-out for users whoâ€™re not sure what theyâ€™re looking for yet. Other options to include might be to a blog, product features or About Us page.
