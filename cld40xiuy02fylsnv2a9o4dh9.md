# Decentralized Distributed Version Control: A Smarter Way to Manage Your Code!

In a decentralized version control system, there is **no central repository** that contains the entire history of the codebase. Instead, each developer has a copy of the entire repository on their local machine, and changes are made and tracked locally.

When developers want to share their changes with other team members, they push their changes to a **remote repository**, which is typically hosted on a server. Other developers can then pull those changes down to their local machines, and merge them into their own copies of the repository.

A distributed version control system, like Git or Mercurial, is a type of decentralized version control system where each developer has a full copy of the entire codebase including the entire version history. This allows developers to work on the codebase independently, without relying on a central server to be available.

In distributed version control systems, each developer has a full copy of the repository including all branches, tags, and commits. This enables them to **work offline, branch, merge, and commit changes locally**, and share their changes with other team members when they are **online**.

This allows for a more flexible and efficient workflow, where developers can work on different features or bug fixes at the same time, and easily merge their changes back into the main codebase.

In summary, the decentralized version control system allows **multiple** copies of the codebase to exist and be worked on simultaneously, while the distributed version control system allows each developer to have a full copy of the codebase, including the entire version history on their local machine.
