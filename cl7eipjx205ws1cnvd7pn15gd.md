### Discussions on August 28 2022:

#### 1. What is Kernel version ?

Kernel is base of the os. Windows used Windows NT-Kernel, Linux used vmlinuz. Kernel version is just the version of the kernel.

#### 2. What is IP address and MAC Address ?

Consider a person who is studying in school. He will be having a name (MAC Address) and a roll number (IP Address). So whenever he is moving to the next grade (7th std -> 8th std), his roll number will be changing but his name wont be changing. 

If he want's to change his name (MAC) that's is also possible.

Our machine (electonic gadgets that connects with internet), will be having a MAC address. Whenever we are connecting to the internet we are provided with an IP address.

#### 3. Why there are many open source licences ?
Each open source license states what users are permitted do with the software components, their obligations, and what they cannot do as per the terms and conditions.
Each licence will have a minor permission level changes. 

Consider you are using GPL Licence, You could modify it and use it for your own purpose as long as you're not distributing it; but if you do distribute it, then your entire project that is using the GPL code also becomes GPL automatically. Which means, it must be open-sourced, and the recipient gets all the same rights as you - meaning, they can turn around and distribute it, modify it, sell it, etc. And that would include your proprietary code which would then no longer be proprietary - it becomes open source.

The difference with MIT is that even if you actually distribute your proprietary code that is using the MIT licensed code, you do not have to make the code open source. You can distribute it as a closed app where the code is encrypted or is a binary. Including the MIT-licensed code can be encrypted, as long as it carries the MIT license notice.

#### 4. What is Ubuntu and FOSS ?

FOSS - (Wikipedia definition) - Free and open-source software (FOSS) is a term used to refer to groups of software consisting of both free software and open-source software where anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve. 

Consider i am selling you a pen, you can use the pen to write, scribble, broke into half, sell it after using it for some time, refill, modify and more. -> this is the general view of FOSS.

Ubuntu: Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.

#### 5. Why we are adding repository before apt-get install in linux ?

add-apt-repository adds a PPA to your list of sources, so that Ubuntu knows to look for updates from that PPA as well as from the official Ubuntu sources. Usually this is used to allow developers to provide updates more quickly than those in the official Ubuntu repositories.

If you were to simply run apt-get install rubygems, you would get a less-recent version (or perhaps nothing at all, depending on whether rubygems is also in the Ubuntu repositories or only in the PPA).

But its better to stick with default ubuntu repositories. 


#### 6. What is KALI Linux ?

Kali linux is a distro for the security related testing, it provides lab for the same. There is also an alternative "Parrot OS". 


#### 7. Will attack happens on TLS Layer or which layer usually hackers target ?

TLS layer is a secure layer. Easily vulnerable layer is HTTP. So only nowadays we are sending data in HTTPS protocol. 

#### 8. Do we need to encrypt message that we send over the network ?

No Need. TLS layer itself will take care of encryption and decryption on both sides.
