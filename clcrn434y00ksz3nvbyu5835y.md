# C++ becomes TIOBE's programming language of the year 2022

C++ is the programming language of the year 2022, dubbed the programming language of choice by TIOBE. This is mainly because it made the biggest gains (+4.62%) in popularity over other languages, and was therefore considered to be the most significant runaway success story in 2022. Since C++ has been steadily rising in TIOBE for many years, this announcement should indicate that C++'s popularity has trended up once again.

Java, C++, JavaScript, and Python are the top 5 programming language skills that companies want to hire for. Other languages such as Rust (position 24), Lua (24), F# (23), Kotlin (25), and Julia (29) are also doing well in the job market.

Rust and F# are both rising in popularity, but Kotlin is not far behind.
