# Unlocking the Power of Collaboration: The Need and Necessity of Git Workflows

As you all know that makereading.com has started a [git series.](https://makereading.com/series/git) We have learned [evolution](https://makereading.com/git-session-1-evolution-of-version-control-system) and some basics of the [git command.](https://makereading.com/revisiting-git-commands-part-i) But we always have this question,

How in the real world do people organize their branches, how has a bug been fixed, and is there any format been followed ?

.

.

.

and the answer is **YES!**

We have **GitWorkflows,**

**GitWorkflows** are necessary for managing and organizing the different versions and updates of a codebase in a collaborative environment. They provide a set of rules and guidelines for how branches should be created, used, and merged, and ensure that everyone on the team is working in a consistent and organized manner.

One of the main needs for **GitWorkflows** is to separate the different stages of development, such as development, testing, and production. This allows for code to be tested and reviewed before it is released to users, ensuring that only stable and working code is deployed.

GitWorkflows also allows multiple people to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously, without interfering with each other's work.

GitWorkflows also provides the ability to roll back changes easily, in case of issues, by keeping track of different versions of the codebase and going back to a previous version of the codebase if needed.

Additionally, GitWorkflows also enables collaboration and communication among team members, as it provides a clear and organized way of merging code, reviewing it, and keeping track of the changes.

In this Git series, we will concentrate on 2 items,

1. GitHub Workflow
    
2. GitWorkflow
    

In conclusion, GitWorkflows are essential for managing and organizing codebase in a collaborative environment, they ensure that everyone is working in a consistent and organized manner, separate different stages of development allow for multiple people to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously, and enables collaboration, communication, and the ability to rollback changes easily.
