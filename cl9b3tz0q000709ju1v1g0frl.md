(Note: The link is new for weekly discussions. And it is different from the monthly meet link. So use above link for joining weekly discussions)

This weekly discussion is a new initiative, started to create more friendly discussions about Linux and things happening in the FOSS world.

Weekly discussion is an open and friendly discussion where topics related to Linux/FOSS technologies will be discussed. We will meet in the online jitsi meeting and discuss new linux things everyone explored this week and we chat about linux news and topics. If you are facing any issues with linux or any FOSS applications, you can also share your issues during the discussion. Our KanchiLUG community will help to debug or suggest some good alternatives.

Can join with any browser or JitSi android app.
All the Discussions are in Tamil.
