# Project 2 - Serial Activity

During our college times, we had a crash course on Machine Learning. Our coordinators has arranged an ML Engineer to take class for 3 days. During those time, we didn't actually got what he explained apart from linear regression (y = mx + c) ðŸ¤£

But he seeded the interest in our minds on Machine learning; like a butterfly effect now i am more interested in ML than Software Development. 

During those days (in our labs), he insisted to install packages to have hands-on experience. But unfortunately many of our people were not sure about the installations of the packages. So we need to find a solution to install all necessary packages in all machines.

We had a scenario like, all the machines had one specific same user account with same password for all the machines. So we were like; if we are able to automate it in one machine then it would be easy for rest of the machines ( Just a for-loop iterating the x.0.0.1 to x.0.0.255 ). This is the birthplace of this tool.
