## Meta Transitions PyTorch to The Linux Foundation

Meta is shifting the management of [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), a deep learning framework developed by Meta subsidiary Facebook, to the newly formed PyTorch Foundation, which in turn will be under the oversight of [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/).

The creation of the PyTorch Foundation ensures that decisions will be made in a transparent and open manner by a diverse group of board members for many years to come, according to Meta. The governing body will be composed of representatives from AMD, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure and Nvidia, with the intention to expand further over time.

### Who is the linux foundation ?

Founded in 2000, the Linux Foundation and its projects are supported by more than 3,000 members. The Linux Foundation is the world's leading home for collaboration on open source software, hardware, standards, and data. Linux Foundation projects are critical to the world's infrastructure including Linux, Kubernetes, Node.js, ONAP, Hyperledger, RISC-V, PyTorch, and more. The Linux Foundation's methodology focuses on leveraging best practices and addressing the needs of contributors, users, and solution providers to create sustainable models for open collaboration.

### What are the benefits of this transition ?
1. As part of the Linux Foundation, PyTorch and its community will benefit from our many programs and support communities like training and certification programs (we already have one in the works), to community research (like our Project Journey Reports) and, of course, community events.
2. By creating a neutral home, the PyTorch Foundation, we are collectively locking in a future of transparency, communal governance, and unprecedented scale for all.
3. By coming under the big open source (non-profit) organizations it will attract more funding and brilliant minds in adding new functionalites which benefits all. 


### License
Currently pytorch is under BSD Style licence. (not sure will the licence structure will be changing)
