### Introduction

India began administration of COVID-19 vaccines on 16 January 2021. As of 27 October 2021, India has administered over 1.04 billion doses overall, including first and second doses of the currently-approved vaccines. In India, nearly half the eligible population has got at least one shot, and 19 per cent received both nine months after the vaccine rollout.

India initially approved the Oxfordâ€“AstraZeneca vaccine (manufactured under license by Serum Institute of India under the trade name Covishield) and Covaxin (a vaccine developed locally by Bharat Biotech). They have since been joined by the Sputnik V (manufactured under license by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, with additional production from Serum Institute of India being started in September), Moderna vaccines, Johnson & Johnson vaccine and ZyCoV-D (a vaccine locally developed by Zydus Cadila) and other vaccine candidates undergoing local clinical trials.

In this project, we will see the visualization of vaccination taken place as of **Oct 29 2021**

### Data Sources: 

We will be needing two datasets, 
1. Dataset of the covid vaccination - [Link](https://github.com/syedjafer/ml_projects_learning/blob/main/covid-vaccination-india-choropleth/covid_vaccine_statewise.csv)
2. Dataset related to GeoJson of India map - [Link](https://github.com/syedjafer/ml_projects_learning/blob/main/covid-vaccination-india-choropleth/Indian_States)
